1. INSTALLATION OF VIRTUAL STUDIO CODE
a. Head over to the official page of Virtual Studio Code download page and click the "download now" for windows installer executable file
b. Once downloaded, locate the installer file (typically named "VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe") and double-click it to start the installation process.
c. The installer will walk you through some steps like licence agreement, installation location and where the shortcut for VS Code will appear in the Start Menu.
d. After reviewing the options, click "Install" to begin the installation. This should only take a minute or two.
e. Once finished, you'll be given the option to launch Visual Studio Code directly.

2. FIRST TIME SETUP
a. Choose a theme that's easy on your eyes and suits your preferences.
b. Enable auto save to avoid accidental data loss. Search for "Files: Auto Save" and set it to your preference.
c. Install a code formatter extension like "Prettier - Code formatter" to ensure consistent code style.
d. Depending on your programming language, install a dedicated language extension. These provide features like syntax highlighting, IntelliSense (code completion), and debugging specific to your language. Search for extensions like "Python" or "C".
e. Consider a linter extension like "ESLint" to identify potential coding issues and enforce coding standards.
f. If you use Git for version control, install the "Git" extension for seamless integration within VS Code. This allows you to manage your code commits directly from the editor.
g. Enhance your workflow with an extension like "Live Server" for web development. This lets you preview your code changes in a live browser window automatically.

3. USER INTERFACE OVERVIEW
A. ACTIVITY BAR: Provides quick access to different views in VS Code. Icons represent functionalities like File Explorer, Search, Source Control (Git), Run and Debug controls, Extensions management, and more. Clicking an icon switches the main view to the corresponding functionality.

B. SIDE BAR: Houses various views that provide context and tools for your project. The specific views displayed depend on the currently selected activity in the Activity Bar
i. Explorer: Lets you browse and manage your project files and folders.
ii. Search: Enables searching and replacing text across your entire project.
iii. Source Control: Provides Git integration for version control operations like commits, pushes, and viewing code history.
iv. Run and Debug: Controls program execution, setting breakpoints, and debugging your code
v. Extensions: Lists and manages installed extensions for VS Code.

C. EDITOR GROUP: The heart of VS Code where you write and edit your code. You can open multiple files simultaneously, arranged in tabs or split views. The editor provides syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging features, and more (often enhanced by language-specific extensions).

D. STATUS BAR: Displays contextual information about your project and the currently opened files. May show details like:
i. Current line number and column position in the active file.
ii. Git branch and status (if using Git source control).
iii. Language mode of the active file.
iv. Selection mode (e.g., inserting or replacing text).
v. Background tasks running in VS Code.

4. COMMAND PALETTE
The Command Palette in VS Code acts as a central hub for accessing all functionalities and settings within the editor. It's a powerful tool for quickly finding and running specific actions without navigating menus.

Accessing the Command Palette:

There are three ways to open the Command Palette:

i. Keyboard Shortcut: The most common method is using the keyboard shortcut:
Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Shift+P
Mac: Cmd+Shift+P
ii. Menu: Navigate to the View menu and select Command Palette.
iii. Search Bar: Click on the magnifying glass icon in the top right corner of the VS Code window. This opens a search bar where you can start typing the command name to bring it up directly.

Using the Command Palette:

Once opened, the Command Palette displays a search bar. Start typing the name of the command you want to execute, and VS Code will provide suggestions based on what you've entered. You can then select the desired command from the list or continue typing to narrow down the options.

Examples of Common Tasks with the Command Palette:

File Management:
a. Open a specific file: Open File
b. Create a new file: New File
c. Save the active file: Save
Code Editing:
a. Find and replace text: Replace
b. Format document: Format Document (may require an extension)
c. Toggle comments on selected lines: Toggle Line Comment
Project Management:
a. Open integrated terminal: Terminal: New Terminal
b. Search for symbols (functions, variables) within the project: Go to Symbol in Workspace
VS Code Settings:
a. Open settings: Preferences: Open Settings (or Code: Preferences: Open Settings on macOS)
b. Install new extensions: Extensions: Install Extension.

5. EXTENSIONS IN VIRTUAL STUDIO CODE
Finding and installing extensions is a breeze within VS Code:

A. Open the Extensions view: Click on the Extensions icon (usually looks like a box with four squares) in the Activity Bar on the left side of the VS Code window. Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+X (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+X (Mac).
B. Browse or Search: The Extensions view provides a featured list and categories to explore extensions. You can also use the search bar to find extensions by name or functionality.
C. Install and Manage: Click the "Install" button for the desired extension. Once installed, you can manage them directly within the Extensions view. You can disable, update, or uninstall extensions as needed.

Essential Extensions for Web Development:
Here are some examples of essential extensions for web development that can significantly enhance your workflow:

Language Support:
A. HTML, CSS, JavaScript: These official extensions provide syntax highlighting, IntelliSense (code completion), and debugging specific to web development languages.
B. Specific Frameworks: If you're using a particular framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js, dedicated extensions offer additional features and tooling tailored to that framework.

Linters and Formatters:
A. ESLint: Identifies potential coding errors and enforces style guidelines for cleaner and more maintainable code.
Prettier: Ensures consistent code formatting across your project, improving readability and reducing merge conflicts.
B. Live Server: This extension allows you to preview your code changes in a live browser window automatically, streamlining your development cycle.

Version Control:
A. Git: Seamless integration with Git for version control. Manage commits, pushes, and view code history directly within VS Code.
B. Debuggers: Extensions like "Debugger for Chrome" or "Debugger for Firefox" enable debugging your web applications directly within VS Code. Set breakpoints, step through code execution, and inspect variables during debugging sessions.

Productivity Boosters:
A. Live Share: Collaborate with others on your code in real-time within VS Code.
Remote Development: Develop and debug your web applications directly on a remote server or container environment.

Advantages of Using the Integrated Terminal:

A. Efficiency: Quickly switch between editing code and running commands without leaving the editor.
B. Integration: Seamlessly interact with your project files and folders.
C. Customization: Customize the terminal's appearance and behavior to match your preferences.
D. Features: Take advantage of VS Code features like IntelliSense and syntax highlighting even in the terminal (for certain commands).
E. Workspace Context: The terminal automatically opens in the project's root directory, saving time and potential errors.

7. FILE AND FOLDER MANAGEMENT
 A. You access files from the explorer: Click on the "New File" icon in the Explorer sidebar. this will create a new, untitled file in the current directory and double-click on the desired file in the Explorer sidebar to open them.

 Creating of folders from explorer: Right-click on an existing folder and select "New Folder". You can also right-click on the empty space in the Explorer and choose "New Folder".

Navigating Between Files and Directories

A. Explorer: The Explorer sidebar provides a tree-like view of your project structure. You can expand and collapse folders to navigate through your project.
B. File Navigation Bar: This bar at the top of the editor shows the current file path. You can click on different parts of the path to navigate to parent directories.

Keyboard Shortcuts:
Ctrl+P (or Cmd+P on macOS): Opens the Quick Open dialog, allowing you to search for files and quickly open them.
Ctrl+Tab (or Cmd+Tab): Switches between open files.
Ctrl+Shift+E (or Cmd+Shift+E): Opens the Explorer.
